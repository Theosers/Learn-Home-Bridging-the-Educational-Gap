### General Info

The project's primary goal was to facilitate remote academic support for students regardless of their location. Learn@Home aimed to enhance communication between students and volunteers directly through their website, replacing their previous reliance on WhatsApp.

My role encompassed project scoping and coordination of all development efforts with the team. We began by defining comprehensive functional requirements based on client needs and created technical prototypes using domain models and mock-ups. This ensured a clear project vision and a solid technical solution for the client.
Through effective project management and teamwork, we successfully delivered a solution that improved access to academic support for students facing scholastic challenges.
